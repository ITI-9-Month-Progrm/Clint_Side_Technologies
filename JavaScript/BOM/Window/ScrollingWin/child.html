       “I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you;

       I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.

       I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse;

       and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.” 
       Most of us wonder if there is a God and if He really is the God of the Bible. In the Bible God says 
       ‘I will make your name great’ and today the name of Abraham/Abram is known worldwide. This promise has come true.
        The earliest copy of Genesis found in the Dead Sea Scrolls is dated 200-100 B.C. 
        which means the promise has been in writing since at least that time. At that time the name of Abraham was not well-known so the promise came true only after it was written down, not before.
